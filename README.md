# The Turing Act

Inspired by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/ModernWood/status/994286738603368448) related to Google's Duplex demo.

## What is this?

This is a placeholder - mostly a novelty site - for the idea of
regulating the way Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning driven
tools (such as 100% virtual phone assistants) interact with humans who
are not otherwise aware they are not interacting with a human.

The goal is to create guidelines for how the virtual assistants announce
themselves, as well as careful monitoring of the techniques they employ
in two-way communication with humans.

## What's Next?
